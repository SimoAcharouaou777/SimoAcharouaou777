I'm a passionate coding enthusiast with ambitious goals to become a proficient full-stack developer. Currently, I'm a student at 'YOU CODE,' a prestigious school in Morocco, where I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My future aspirations include working on exciting 3D projects for top-tier companies and crafting outstanding websites. 

🌱 At this stage, I'm an enthusiastic learner with no prior professional experience, but I'm determined to grow.

🎙️ In addition to my coding journey, I'm also a voice-over enthusiast who loves sharing my voice with the community.
